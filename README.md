# JacksRecordShop
A responsive, interactive music discovery website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was developed as part of a front-end web development learning experience, focusing on clean design, user interaction, and iterative UX improvement.

## Features

- **Interactive Song Display**: Click on album covers to play/pause song previews and view song details.
- **Shuffle Function**: Randomizes the displayed songs with a dedicated shuffle button.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts layout for desktop and mobile viewing.
- **UX-Tested Interface**: Iteratively refined based on feedback from multiple users to improve visual clarity and interaction.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Process & Documentation

This project followed a structured 10-phase iterative development process documented in two key files:

1. **Full Iterative Process**: See `SuperFan Iterative Process Slides.pdf.`
   - Brainstorming three interactive concepts
   - Design, wireframing, and responsive implementation
   - JavaScript functionality and polish phases

2. **UX Testing & Iteration**: See `UX Testing + UI Iteration.pdf`
   - Feedback from 4 users
   - UI improvements based on identified trends
   - Final refinements to shuffle function, borders, and audio behavior

## Key Iterations Based on User Feedback

- Enhanced shuffle functionality
- Improved background image quality
- Adjusted borders on album covers for better readability
- Resolved audio overlap issues with fade-out on click
- Refined button placement and visual effects (shadows, hover states)
